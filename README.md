The only smartphone that wants less of your time
## Features
Time
 It’s pretty common for us to spend ten, twenty or even thirty hours per week on general unfocused smartphone use.  That time can be freed up and redirected towards whatever it is you choose – reading actual books, getting out and exercising, learning something new, starting a side hustle – it’s all there if you have the time. 

Focus
Every time you stop a task to check your phone for notifications, you lose focus on what you are doing.  The BoringPhone doesn’t have social media or email, which reduces notifications.  You’ll still be available for calls or important messages from friends and family, but you won’t be interrupted because a picture of an egg is trending. 

Connection
We’ve all been guilty of it:  Half listening to someone while waiting for them to finish so we can check our phone, or simply looking at our phone while we’re talking to people. It’s not the end of the world, but it is good to be really present with our friends, family and partners. Removing the smartphone can remove barriers and allow the space to truly connect with the people that matter to us. 

Privacy And Cost Saving
Smartphones these days are set up to suck up as much data as possible. Multiple apps track not just their own usage, but our location and other data they can access.  The BoringPhone slows this deluge down to a trickle.   Less data also means less cost.
